The Trainyards is a dedicated spaceport on Ceres. It is where the various mining ships unload their mineral cargo to have it evaluated, tagged, and put in an Astro Container for shipment to Earth.

It is called Trainyards because it sends astro containers to Earth in a regular fashion, like wagon trains of old.
