The largest planet in our solar system. This gas giant is not habitable, but several of its moons could be colonized in the future.

Its size makes it a giant gravity well and it is thought that its mere presence permitted the continued existence of the smaller inner planets, which on a geological time scale should have been hit by celestial bodies much more often.
