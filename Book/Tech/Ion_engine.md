An engine that uses non-ionizing radiation to provide constant thrust in a vacuum. Following the basic E=mc^2 law, it only takes a little bit of matter to generate a lot of energy and the ion engine is able to convert that into thrust.

This made interplanetary travel viable since at constant thrust, if you can maintain about 1g, you can easily reach 847 km/s in 24 hours. Since Mars is 225,000,000 km away from the Earth on average, covering 847 km every second would mean a travel time of 73 hours.

Obviously if you reach Mars at 847 km/s you will overshoot it and not be able to land, so half the trip is accelerating at 1g, then the ship turns around and the other half of the trip is decelerating at 1g.

In practice, accelerating at 1g for 72 hours should bring you to a speed of 2,541,883 m/s or about 1% of the speed of light so you can still maintain newtonian physics on your trip to Mars. None of that relativisitc weirdness.
