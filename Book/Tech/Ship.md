Spaceships come in various shapes and sizes. The most common one is the mining cruiser which allows crews of two people to travel unassisted for up to two weeks. Their ion engines are simple and reliable, and can provide powerful, sustained sub-light thrust suitable for braking and acceleration.

Such crafts can make the trip from Earth orbit to moon orbit in about an hour, including deceleration.
