The Funcor 1000 High-Intensity Drill is a combination of a mining drill and a pneumatic hammer, designed to separate the rocky and metallic parts of an asteroid.

It has an operating range of 50K to 240K as it is lubricated with a silicone component that solidifies at water-freezing temperatures.

It contains an on-board spectrometer and can isolate and follow veins of specific elements and materials as it is drilling.

There have been trials with self-replicating machines but they were not satisfactory as the machines broke beyond their own ability to repair themselves.
