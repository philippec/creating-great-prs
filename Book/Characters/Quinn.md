Quinn comes from a wealthy family on Earth. With an ivy-league education, Quinn was destined to a life in high society among the elites but yearned for a more meaningful life.

The easiest way to get away from her family was to join the mining colony on Ceres, where adventure awaits. This pisses her father off to no end, which secretly pleases Quinn.

Quinn is M-F transgender, and identifies as female.
