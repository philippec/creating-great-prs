# Chapter 1
## Mine your own business

The pipe let out a plume of silicone, which quickly froze into crystalline droplets. "Gotcha!" muttered 👤Quinn under her breath, holding the titanium pipe wrench with two hands.

"Everything OK down there?" 👤Parker's voice came in loud and clear through the comms. "You bet! Pressure on the 🔧drill should now be back to normal", replied 👤Quinn. She unclipped herself from the drill assembly, effortlessly gliding up the access pole that was her only guide in the mineshaft, since the opening was pitch black, facing the interstellar void. 

"OK, let's get back to the 🔧ship. I'm running low on 🔧O2 and I don't need you to bail me out like the last time", said 👤Parker. "Made me look like a chump at the company mess hall when they showed that video on the viewscreen on Thanksgiving dinner."

"That was two weeks ago", thought 👤Quinn as she emerged from the mineshaft. She gave the customary tap of gratitude to the equipement, and both she and 👤Parker clipped on the 🔧ship's tether and pushed themselves off the 📍asteroid surface, ascending effortlessly like two superheroes without capes.

There's very little gravity on the smaller 📍asteroids, which makes the drilling easier since there's not much to hold things together. Think of a loose snowball of ice and rocks, where you can push things around much more easily because there's no mortar between the bricks, so to speak. Unfortunately, it also makes things a lot more dangerous since your mining shaft can collapse at any time. Hence the automated drilling.

Asteroid mining was a lucrative field. Rocks in the 📍asteroid belt between 📍Mars and 📍Jupiter are rich in metallic elements, and their exploration started in the mid 21st century as the energy industry started to look for alternative sources of lithium and cobalt to power the electrification of everything.

It was quickly discovered that shipping the unrefined ore back to 📍Earth was not economically feasible, but to everyone's surprise, high concentrations of rare-earth elements that had not shown up on long-range spectrograms turned out to be highly valuable in the magnet industry. Everything runs on electricity, but to make things move you need magnets. And rare-earth magnets are the most powerful of all.

"I can't wait to get out of this suit and into a shower". "A-men", said 👤Quinn as she punched in the coordinates to 📍Ceres. "It'll be good to get back to a little gravity". The 🔧ship rumbled as the 🔧ion_engines came to life. The tether retracted, they veered off on a complex course back to the largest object in the Belt by far.
