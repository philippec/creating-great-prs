# Chapter 2
## The Operative

Somehow, things felt different when you were decelerating. 👤The_Operative was on a commercial transport bound for 📍Ceres. The 🔧ship had turned around some time ago, pointing its powerful 🔧ion_engines towards its destination.

🔧Ion_engines are what made interplanetary travel possible without months of boredom. Much like one would compare a jetliner to a 14th century caravelle and marvel that you could cross an ocean in hours, we could now travel the 225 million kilometers to Mars in a few more hours, all while maintaining a comfortable gravity environment due to constant acceleration or deceleration. Thus, you could accelerate at 1 g for half of your travel, turn the ship around at mid-point, and decelerate at 1 g until you reached your destination. Weightlessness and its discomfort was limited to boarding, and a brief period in the middle of the trip.

👤The_Operative smiled. It was ironic that one of the greatest inventions of the 21st century would contribute to the most spectacular blackmail operation in history.

The 🔧ship started rotating slowly counter-clockwise. The captain's voice announced on the PA "Flight attendants, please prepare for docking". The attendants scurried about, making sure that everyone was correctly strapped in before returning to their own seats, walking sideways like a drunken sailor to counteract the 🔧ship's rotation.

After matching 📍Ceres's spaceport rotational speed, the 🔧ship entered the docking area stern-first and was gently caught by the docking clamps of platform 1A. The clamps retracted and the 🔧ship landed with a dull thud that everyone felt more than they heard.

"Ladies and gentlemen welcome to 📍Ceres. We'll open the hatch as soon as the pressure seal has equalized. In the meantime please remain strapped in your seats. The local gravity is 0.38 g, just be careful when you stand up and be patient".

They scanned their identity card at the terminal. It beeped, and a name appeared along with a picture that resembled them. "Monica Walker, Contractor, Level 3". That would be enough to get inside the operation center known as 📍The_Trainyards.
